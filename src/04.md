# ASYNC 

## mini redis is left 
Attribute means characteristic.
A handler is routine/function/,methods which is typically specialized in a certain type of data or focused on certain special tasks.
# Rocket rust 
Routing handler are focused in routes and handler.
A handles is simply function.
Rocket main task is to listen to the web request.
Before dispatching the request rocket need to mounted.
`Routing` It refers to the route made for the data to travel the destination.
`Mount` it simply means to add the additional information. 
And before routing it is important to mount the route .
The main difference is that Web API uses the HTTP verb, not the URI path, to select the action. 
`Launching` Rockets start serving the request after being launched and it starts a multithreaded async server and dispatches the request to matching routes as they arrive.
Async run time is created to launch the server. #[launch] and #[rocket::main]are two  method to launc the server .
n REST architecture, statelessness refers to a communication method in which the server completes every client request independently of all previous requests. Clients can request resources in any order, and every request is stateless or isolated from other requests.
```Future and Async```
Rocket  use rust `Future` for concurrency .A future represents an asynchronous computation obtained by use of async.
A future is a value that might not have finished computing yet. This kind of “asynchronous value” makes it possible for a thread to continue doing useful work while it waits for the value to become available.The core method of future, poll, attempts to resolve the future into a final value. This method does not block if the value is not ready. Instead, the current task is scheduled to be woken up when it’s possible to make further progress by polling again.
```Concurrency``` Concurrency or concurrent computing refers to the form of computing in which multiple computing tasks occur simultaneously or at overlapping times.
Rocket's make it easy to use async/await .Async function make it easy to use handler.
Rust future are form of cooperative multitasking.it will .awaits on the operations and never block.
 `Methods` A Rocket route attribute can be any one of the `get ,post,put delete,head,patch or options` each correspoinding to the HTTP methods to match against.It will match against the root path .
 `HEAD Request` Rocket handles HEAD requests automatically when there exists a GET route that would otherwise match. 
` Dynamics Paths` You can declare path segements as dynamic by using angel brackets around the variable.

# API  endpoint 
 An Api endpoint is the a URL that acts as the points of contact  between an API client and an API  server. API clients send request to API endpoint in order to access the API's functionality and data.
