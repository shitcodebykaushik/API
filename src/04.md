# Rocket rust 
Routing handler are focused in routes and handler.
A handles is simply function.
Rocket main task is to listen to the web request.
Before dispatching the request rocket need to mounted.
`Routing` It refers to the route made for the data to travel the destination.
`Mount` it simply means to add the additional information. 
And before routing it is important to mount the route .
The main difference is that Web API uses the HTTP verb, not the URI path, to select the action. 
`Launching` Rockets start serving the request after being launched and it starts a multithreaded async server and dispatches the request to matching routes as they arrive.
Async run time is created to launch the server. #[launch] and #[rocket::main]are two  method to launc the server .
n REST architecture, statelessness refers to a communication method in which the server completes every client request independently of all previous requests. Clients can request resources in any order, and every request is stateless or isolated from other requests.
