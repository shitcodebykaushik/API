# Api 
API gives you two things .
Data and Protocol.
It give the accesss to initiate the conversation between different progrming stuff in computer.


# Actix web 
ctrl+c is for shutting down the server of actix web.
# ASYNC 

## mini redis is left 
Attribute means characteristic.
A handler is routine/function/,methods which is typically specialized in a certain type of data or focused on certain special tasks.
# Rocket rust 
Routing handler are focused in routes and handler.
A handles is simply function.
Rocket main task is to listen to the web request.
Before dispatching the request rocket need to mounted.
`Routing` It refers to the route made for the data to travel the destination.
`Mount` it simply means to add the additional information. 
And before routing it is important to mount the route .
The main difference is that Web API uses the HTTP verb, not the URI path, to select the action. 
`Launching` Rockets start serving the request after being launched and it starts a multithreaded async server and dispatches the request to matching routes as they arrive.
Async run time is created to launch the server. #[launch] and #[rocket::main]are two  method to launc the server .
n REST architecture, statelessness refers to a communication method in which the server completes every client request independently of all previous requests. Clients can request resources in any order, and every request is stateless or isolated from other requests.
```Future and Async```
Rocket  use rust `Future` for concurrency .A future represents an asynchronous computation obtained by use of async.
A future is a value that might not have finished computing yet. This kind of “asynchronous value” makes it possible for a thread to continue doing useful work while it waits for the value to become available.The core method of future, poll, attempts to resolve the future into a final value. This method does not block if the value is not ready. Instead, the current task is scheduled to be woken up when it’s possible to make further progress by polling again.
```Concurrency``` Concurrency or concurrent computing refers to the form of computing in which multiple computing tasks occur simultaneously or at overlapping times.
Rocket's make it easy to use async/await .Async function make it easy to use handler.
Rust future are form of cooperative multitasking.it will .awaits on the operations and never block.
 `Methods` A Rocket route attribute can be any one of the `get ,post,put delete,head,patch or options` each correspoinding to the HTTP methods to match against.It will match against the root path .
 `HEAD Request` Rocket handles HEAD requests automatically when there exists a GET route that would otherwise match. 
` Dynamics Paths` You can declare path segements as dynamic by using angel brackets around the variable.
`URI` It stands for the uniform resource identifier. URL AND URN are the further parts of these things .
# API  endpoint 
 An Api endpoint is the a URL that acts as the points of contact  between an API client and an API  server. API clients send request to API endpoint in order to access the API's functionality and data.
  ## At first we going to create an API end point 
  ## Then we are going to access the API end point .
 `Routes` refers to the the process of determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpointpoinor URL, which is a path on the server . Function are known as route handler .
 ```Rust
 #[macro_use]
extern crate rocket;
#[get("/")]  // "/" this is root path of the rocket application. which is invoked when client makes the request.
             // GET is used by client to request data from the server . It is one of the famous method of the HTTP
fn index() ->String {
  String::from ("HI")
}
#[launch]
fn rocket() -> _ {
 rocket::build() // This is use to compile and build rocker application 
  .mount("/", routes![index]) // In context mount means attaching the set of routes with the specific path in the application.


}
 ```
 # Few key terms use in API 
`Address`
  - This configuration allow the speicifies the IP addres on which the Rocket server will listen for incoming connection .
   - Loopback = It simply means that it allow device to send and receive its own data packets. In this we send data to ourself in same system .
   The common port used in this is IPv4, 127.0.0.1 which can range upto  127.255.255.255.
`Port`
  - A port is virtual point where network connection start ans end .Port are software based and managed by computer'operating system . 
  - The port number specifies the the port number on which the rocket server will listen. 
  Port Number:8000  reserved for the http communication.
  Port Number: 8000
   TCP / UDP: TCP
   Delivery: Yes
   Protocol / Name: irdmi
   Port Description: iRDMI
   Virus / Trojan: No
 

`Workers`
In context of the Actix Web and many other we framework or servers ,a worker refers to a seperate thread or process that is responsible for handling the incoming reuests and processing it asyncronously.Workers enable the concurrent processing of multiple requests,allowing the server to handle a larger number of simulataneous connection and improve the overall performance and scalability of the web application or Api. 
.workers(n) // Configure the number of workers.
The workers configuration specifies the number of worker threads that will be used to handle incoming HTTP requests concurrently.
Setting this to 16 means that the server can handle up to 16 requests concurrently.

# Methods
 # Basic URL for local host
 http://localhost:8080/
`Post`= This methods submits an entity to the specified resources.This may results in change in state or side effects on the server.
`Put` = 
`Get` = This methods request a represtation of the speicified resource.Requests using GET should only retrive data.
`Delete`=It delete the specified resource.
`Head` = This methods ask for a response identical to a get request,but without the response body.
`Patch`= It applies partial modification to a resource.
`Options`= The options methods describes the communication options for the target resource. 





# Dynamic paths 
 We can create path segments as a dynamic path using angel brackets. Arounds varible names in the route path.
 

# Building An Email Newsletter
Iterations menas repeations of stuff .
Rust macros operate at the tocker level:It means that the purpose of rust macros is code generation.


# Production level test 
```Rust
use actix_web::{web, App, HttpRequest, HttpServer, Responder};
async fn greet(req: HttpRequest) -> impl Responder {
let name = req.match_info().get("name").unwrap_or("World");
format!("Hello {}!", &name)
}
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
HttpServer::new(|| {
App::new()
.route("/", web::get().to(greet))
.route("/{name}", web::get().to(greet))
})
.bind("127.0.0.1:8000")?
.run()
.await
}
```


# HttpServer
The main work is to handles all transport level concerns.
# App
It is the top level builder for an Actix web APPLICATION.
It is where all our application logic lives:routing ,middlewares,request handler,etc.
It main job is to take an incoming request as input and spit out a response.
All actix-web server are built around the App instance .It is used for registerting routes for resource and middleware,It also stores application state shared accross all handlers within the same scope.
`Handlers`Are the function or methods that handle incoming http reqwest.It is use to define the logic and behaviour of the API endpoints. Request handling,Response Generation and Data transformation are some common feature of Actix handlers.
 # Scope 
 A collection of Route and resource or other service that share common path prefix(Common paath thaat is added to the begning of the multiple related routes to group them together under a common a common URL path.)
 Here we have the example of common path that we have used in which the scope is used to define the multiple resource.
 `web::scope()` this is the method which allow us setting the resource group prefix.
  ```Rust
    web::scope("/{project_id}")
        .service(web::resource("/path1").to(|| async { "OK" }))
        .service(web::resource("/path2").route(web::get().to(|| HttpResponse::Ok())))
        .service(web::resource("/path3").route(web::head().to(HttpResponse::MethodNotAllowed)));

  ```
# State 
It refers to the shared data or resource that can be accessed and modified by multple parts of the application. `Application state` It is the stat shared across all instance of the application.web::App is the configure way of it . 
and `Request state`: State specifies to an individual HTTP request.web::App is the configured way. 
 Are the two different type of state in actix framework.
 # Shared Mutable State
  An HTTPserver constructs an application instance for each thread,for sharing of data between different threads a shareable objects is used,eg `Send+sync`.
  Application factory means defining the function that creates and configure the application when it is called this define the more flexibilty .
  Application instance(single occurence) means defining the instance that is ready to accept the Http and route them to the apporiate handlers.It is created withing the  'HttpServer::new() ` method without using the application function .

  # Guards
   A simply function that accepts a request objects reference and return the true or false.
  A gurads are used during the routing to helps select a matching service or handlers using some aspects of the request;
  # Configure
   Used for further configuration and customize the application by adding the miidleware,service,routes and other setting .
   ` ServiceConfig` Enables parts of the app configuration to be declared seperately from the app itself .Helful for modularizing the large application.
# How do we test an Endpoint?
An API is means to an end: a tool exposed to the ooutside worls to perform some kind of task eg. store a a document, publish an emian ,etc.
And the endpoint we expose in out API is the contract between us and clients: a shared agreement about the inputs and the outputs of the system,its interface.

Concept of blackbox :- In this we verify the behaviour of a system by examinig its output given a set of inputs without having access to the details of its internal implementation.

# Server
General purpose TCP server that runs services receiving from Tokio `TCPStreams`
It handles creating the worker threads,restarting faluted workers,connection accepting,ans back-pressure logic.
Create  a worker per CPU core  and distributes connection with the round-robin strategy.
The HttpServer type is responsible for serving HTTP requests..
Https servers accepts the  application factory as a parameter and the application factory must hace `send+sync` boundraries.
To start a web server we first must bound to a network sockets.The sockets will fail if we the socket is used by the another applications.
```Rust
pub struct HttpServer<F, I, S, B>
where
    F: Fn() -> I + Send + Clone + 'static,
    I: IntoServiceFactory<S, Request>,
    S: ServiceFactory<Request, Config = AppConfig>,
    S::Error: Into<Error>,
    S::InitError: Debug,
    S::Response: Into<Response<B>>,
    B: MessageBody,
{ /* private fields */ }
```
# TLS and HTTPS
 Actix web support two TLS implementation out of the the box: `rustls` and `openssl`

 # Keep-Alive
 keep alive connection behavior is defined by server settings.

Duration::from_secs(75) or KeepAlive::Timeout(75): enables 75 second keep-alive timer.
KeepAlive::Os: uses OS keep-alive.
None or KeepAlive::Disabled: disables keep-alive.
Keep-alive is off for HTTP/1.0 and is on for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.0.
# Graceful shutdown
HttpsServer ssupport graceful shutdown.After receiving a stop signal workers have a specific amount of time to finish serveing requests.

# Extractor
It is a type-safe request. where the framework ensure that the data received g=from the client-side is parased and validated according to the expected data types and the structure defined in the server side code.
Type checking ,Data Validation and Security are the key feature of this.
Actix web supports 12 extractoe per handler function.Argument position doesnt matter.

# Path
Resource path match the information.
`web::Path <T>` is use to extract and validate a speific path paramenter from incoming HTTP request URL.
 # Query
 Extract typed information from the request’s query.
